# Try out the Solidity Template

1. Start a new project using the [Solidity Template](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-template)
2. Make a fork of mainnet from the command line (you may need to setup an Infura or
Alchemy account)
3. Query the mainnet using the command line to retrieve a property such as latest block
number.

## Solidity

1. Write a function that will delete items (one at a time) from a dynamic array without leaving gaps in the array. You should assume that the items to be deleted are chosen at random, and try to do this in a gas efficient manner.
For example imagine your array has 12 items and you need to delete the items at indexes 8, 2 and 7.

    The final array will then have items (0,1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11}
